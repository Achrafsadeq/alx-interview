## Description
This project contains a Python solution to determine if all locked boxes can be opened given a set of boxes containing keys to other boxes.

## Requirements
### General

- All files should end with a new line
- The first line of all your files should be exactly `#!/usr/bin/python3`
- A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
- Your code should be documented
- Your code should use the PEP 8 style (version 1.7.x)
- All your files must be executable

## Task
### 0. Lockboxes
