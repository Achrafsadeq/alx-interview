# 0x07. Rotate 2D Matrix

## Description

This project contains a Python function that rotates an `n x n` 2D matrix 90 degrees clockwise **in place**, meaning it does not return a new matrix but instead modifies the original one. This is a common algorithmic interview question designed to test knowledge of matrix manipulation and in-place operations.

## Installation

Install Python 3.8:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install python3.8
````

Ensure `pycodestyle` is installed:

```bash
sudo pip3 install pycodestyle==2.8.0
```

## Usage

Create your matrix and run the test script:

```bash
./main_0.py
```

Example output:

```bash
[[7, 4, 1],
 [8, 5, 2],
 [9, 6, 3]]
```

## Requirements

* Python 3.8 (Ubuntu 20.04 LTS)
* No importing of external modules
* Code must follow **pycodestyle** style (version 2.8.0)
* All files should end with a new line
* The first line of each file should be exactly `#!/usr/bin/python3`
* All scripts must be executable
* All functions and modules must be documented

## Concepts Covered

* 2D Matrix representation in Python (lists of lists)
* Accessing and modifying matrix elements
* Transposing matrices
* Reversing rows for 90Â° rotation
* In-place operations to optimize space complexity
* Nested loops and control flow in Python
