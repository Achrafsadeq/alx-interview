 # 0x02-minimum_operations

## Description
This project contains a Python solution to calculate the minimum number of operations (Copy All and Paste) needed to achieve exactly `n` 'H' characters in a text file, starting from a single 'H'.

## Requirements
### General
- Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
- All files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.4.3)
- All files should end with a new line
- The first line of all your files should be exactly `#!/usr/bin/python3`
- A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
- Your code should be documented
- Your code should use the PEP 8 style (version 1.7.x)
- All your files must be executable

## Task
### 0. Minimum Operations
**mandatory**

In a text file, there is a single character H. Your text editor can execute only two operations in this file: Copy All and Paste. Given a number `n`, write a method that calculates the fewest number of operations needed to result in exactly `n` H characters in the file.

**Prototype:**
```python
def minOperations(n)
```
