# Pascal's Triangle

## **Description**

This project involves implementing a Python function to generate Pascal's Triangle up to a given number of rows. Pascal's Triangle is a mathematical construct where each number is the sum of the two directly above it. The triangle has applications in algebra, probability, and combinatorics.

## **Learning Objectives**

By completing this project, you will:
- Understand the structure and properties of Pascal's Triangle.
- Strengthen your Python skills, particularly with lists, loops, and functions.
- Practice writing clean, efficient, and well-documented code.
- Develop problem-solving skills by translating a mathematical concept into code.

## **Must Know**

To successfully complete this project, you should revise the following Python concepts:

| **Concept**               | **Details**                                                                 |
|---------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Lists & List Comprehensions** | Creating, accessing, modifying, and iterating over lists. Using comprehensions for concise code. |
| **Functions**             | Defining functions, passing parameters, returning values (lists of lists).  |
| **Loops**                 | Using `for` and `while` loops, especially nested loops for triangle generation. |
| **Conditional Statements**| Applying `if-elif-else` logic (e.g., setting edge values to 1).             |
| **Recursion (Optional)**  | Alternative approach using recursive function calls.                        |
| **Arithmetic Operations** | Performing addition to calculate triangle elements.                         |
| **Indexing & Slicing**    | Accessing elements/slices of lists to compute new rows.                     |
| **Memory Management**     | Handling list storage/copying when building new rows.                       |
| **Error Handling**        | Using `try-except` for invalid inputs (optional).                           |
| **Efficiency**            | Optimizing time/space complexity of the solution.                           |

## **Tasks**

### **0. Pascal's Triangle**
**Mandatory**  
Implement a function `def pascal_triangle(n):` that returns a list of lists representing Pascalâ€™s Triangle of size `n`.

**Requirements:**
- Returns an empty list if `n <= 0`.
- Assume `n` is always an integer.

**Example:**
```python
guillaume@ubuntu:~/0x00$ ./0-main.py
[1]
[1,1]
[1,2,1]
[1,3,3,1]
[1,4,6,4,1]
```
